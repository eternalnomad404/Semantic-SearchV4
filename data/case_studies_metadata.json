However, the organisation encountered several systemic and operational challenges that limited its ability to scale impact while maintaining quality:\nInconsistent Quality of Counselling: Field officers were trained in maternal and child health protocols, but there was no system in place to ensure that every visit followed standardised steps. The absence of structured decision support meant that important clinical questions were sometimes missed, leading to variable care across households and geographies.\nIneffective Scheduling and Follow-Up: There was no tool available to help workers prioritise daily visits or ensure timely follow-ups. As a result, high-risk cases especially pregnant women and children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) or Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)were often delayed or missed entirely. Missed visits had direct implications for early detection and timely intervention.\nTools to add\nPowerBI\nGlific Chatbot\nWhatsapp\nNo Distinction in Protocols for Critical Cases: FMCH lacked dedicated workflows or alert systems for malnutrition cases. Without a specific protocol for SAM/MAM, field staff had no way to escalate urgent cases or adjust visit frequency based on severity. This delayed treatment and compromised outcomes for vulnerable children.\nFragmented Data and Limited Insights: Manual data collection led to information silos, inconsistent recordkeeping, and limited visibility into program performance. Managers could not track field productivity, assess compliance with protocols, or use real-time data to make course corrections.\nTogether, these issues posed a significant barrier to FMCH’s mission: delivering timely, high-quality, and equitable care to every mother and child. The organisation needed a solution that not only digitised field workflows but truly enabled field workers to do their jobs better with greater precision, efficiency, and empathy.\nSolution Development\nTo address these challenges and strengthen service delivery, FMCH developed NuTree, a multilingual mobile application designed to streamline field operations and enhance accountability. The app provided frontline workers with structured, protocol-based counselling workflows, ensuring consistent delivery of health and nutrition information across all visits. Through built-in decision trees and multimedia learning aids, NuTree empowered field officers to tailor communication to each family’s context while maintaining adherence to clinical guidelines.\nThe platform featured intelligent scheduling tools that prioritised high-risk cases and helped reduce missed visits.
